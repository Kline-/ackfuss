Example:  prompt <%hhp %mmn %vmv>

  (Here, we assume 10 is what your character has..)
 
  You may ask around for the best prompt forms, as others may have found one that they like, or experiment on your own and see what works for you.  Remember, you can put color in your prompts.. make certain numbers stand out.
